Management, who was understaffing in the first place. Who was loading you with too much work. Management, who was not addressing performance issues that were harming the rest of you.\n\nOverachievers didn't cause this harmful environment. Bad management did. Because with good management, there would be no need or incentive to submit to an abusive schedule.\n\nI was a manager for years at a company that took advantage of its employees like this. I left, and now I'm a management consultant focusing on organizational strategy and humane design. Your problem is not the fault of workers.

You also stated that you were making 27% more money for 3 times the work - and you found it wasn't worth it. Therefore, it's clear your argument applies to both minimum wage workers and low wage workers.\n\nYou also stated that you either have employees, or you plan on having employees. Since you're stepping down from a supervisor position at a fast food restaurant, I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you won't be able to pay your employees a substantial salary. But I'm also going to assume you aren't going to pay them minimum wage either.\n\nQuick question: Which employees are you going to give raises to and promote? The ones who only do what they are told, or the employees who go above and beyond?\n\nThese questions are rhetorical. I just want to establish that you do believe extra effort can result in better, worthwhile, compensation. If you plan on promoting your own employees based on how hard they work, you will have to accept that hard work is important for upward mobility.\n\nBut your argument is not that \"extra hard\" work doesn't help employees in general, but that it doesn't help minimum wage workers. This is where I disagree.\n\nu\/ThyKingToker, **I propose that you are misattributing the problem to minimum wage jobs when the problem is something else.**\n\nIt's true, working extra hard can create situations where people are expected to do more without proper compensation. However, this problem can exist *regardless* of wages. Even a person who makes 50k per year, much higher than minimum wage, can be put in a position where they work harder, create tighter deadlines for themselves, and gain nothing out of it.\n\nSo why the emphasis on minimum\/low wage workers?\n\nAs you stated, you were only being paid 27% more for what was the equivalent of 3 jobs.

{"body":"Let's say you have a Walmart store. Walmart store managers earn $175,000 per year. In that store, there is one manager.\n\nOK, now in your view of the world, let's say *every single worker* in Walmart, just for arguments sake - don't say it will never happen - *every single worker* works their ass off. They have GODlike work habits, just the absolute best in the world. \n\nOk, so there are 4,743 Walmarts in the USA. And there are 1.6 million employees. So the question is for me: How is Walmart going to build 1.6 million stores so that all of the employees can be a store manager and make $175,000 per year? And even then, who will be the clerks and stock people in those new 1.6 million stores? And if all of them work super hard, they will probably have to open up a billion stores in the USA so all those new people can become store managers.\n\n.\n\nSo, what I am saying is that your scenario is make believe. There are a lot of workers in Walmart, I'm 100% sure, that work super hard, and while they want to rise in the store hierarchy, will never, never, never get a promotion, ever. Never. Because Walmart needs low paid workers. \n\n.\n\nThis is why the motto for minimum wage workers is: Minimum wage equals minimum effort. [Work just hard enough not to get fired.](work just hard enough not to get fired)\n\n.\n\nNow, a lot of people say that one should work hard to get promoted and show initiative. People who say this are generally kids that are going to university. They are going to graduate from university and hope to go on to jobs where they make $60K, $70K or more, and have a long-term trajectory to do that and more. So why not work as hard as you can? It doesn't really matter to *you*. For you, it's just a summer job. Or a job you do while in school. But, for some people, all they can do is make minimum wage for the rest of their life, no matter how hard they work. Maybe because it is that they don't have the mental horsepower.

Or as much as law requires in this case.\n\nIf every single person worked as hard as the hardest worker, it could be argued that this makes higher wages much more likely. Any boss knows that really good workers are rare. If you get them you typically want to keep them. If all your workers are really good, you will incentivize them to stay because overall you'll still come out way ahead. \n\nAnd if you don't, they'll leave for better opportunities.\n\nMinimum wage jobs do not have the expectation that you will work as hard as you can. Yes, employers will always be trying to get more out of reach person. Push them to be better. But this is mutually beneficial.","containsPersuasion":1,"Logos_Class":24.9003984064,"Ethos_Class":24.9003984064,"Pathos_Class":41.9126693227,"id":230,"numPersuasive":351,"numTotal":392}

{"body":">I don't think the blame goes entirely on management. They play a big factor for sure, but as OP said hard workers make it worse for everyone else. I realize this is a very small sample size, but i'm going to put my work example in.   \n>  \n>I work at a hotel, and have been there for 4 years. I had one coworker who would do everything, and pick up everything. He has worked months back to back without a day off for the betterment of the company, and picked up doubles for others. People would quit for something better, and no one else would be hired because the hard worker would pick up the slack. Fine by me i wasn't going to do it, but being constantly asked to cover on your unscheduled time grates on you. My hard working coworker had also been there for 13 years, and had only managed to work their way up to $10.75\/hr. They were overlooked three separate times for management because they needed someone in that position to cover for everyone. The hard worker moved out of state due to relationship stuff, and everything collapsed for the business. Those of us who remained weren't willing to overwork ourselves. So they started hiring new people. Customers are awful so a lot of the new hires couldn't take the abuse, and there was a large turnover. Now we got into raises to keep people. In a matter of three months since the hard worker left, we have hired the people we need, and I have gone from $10.75\/hr to $15\/hr. We have also installed safety glass so things can't be thrown at us, and have upgraded computer systems because we complained, and didn't just deal with it. Among other minor, but quality of life upgrades.  \n>  \n>So by removing the hard worker, all the rest of us benefited.

I've been here for a month. \n\nMy birthday was 2 days ago and my co-workers who I've known for that month like me enough to make me pie for my birthday (I don't like cake) and consistently tell me how it seems like I always know what I'm doing while I'm working there....since day one.\n\nI'm about to be a shift leader at another restaurant that offers benefits and accrued vacation. This is because I work hard. I work well with others, and I care about my performance.\n\nWhy, you ask? Because I need the job.\n\nWould you like to know my background? \nI'm a master SCUBA diver (NAUI) with a degree in biomedical engineering that used to report directly to the COO of a prominent metropolitan research university.\n\nI'm also am alcoholic. Currently recovering at this point, but I will always be one. This led me to where I am now. 30, living with my mom and working fast food with the promise of a job that makes less than a half as much as my salaried job did - and no 401K offerings.\n\nWhat you said in your comment takes away from everyone - not just me - as most people do have trouble showing up on time, just getting through, or maybe it's their second\/third job that they are working to support their family.\n\nSometimes we need help. Sometimes we can't do our best \n\nUnless we've presented a reason otherwise, always, always.. we deserve to be respected.\n\nYou don't know where people came from or what they are trying to leave behind and accomplish now.\n\nEdit: I read some of your other comments and believe you to be a troll. I'm letting my post stay.","containsPersuasion":1,"Logos_Class":26.1248185776,"Ethos_Class":46.4441219158,"Pathos_Class":21.4352685051,"id":388,"numPersuasive":351,"numTotal":392}
{"body":"Oh, woops! I misread what you typed!\n\nThat's a very good point, one I definitely agree with. Even if there isn't an immediate gain, the experience itself can still be incredibly useful.\n\nI've been moving a lot recently, so I'm on my 3rd job in about 4 or 5 years.
